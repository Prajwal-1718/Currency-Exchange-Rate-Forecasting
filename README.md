# Currency Exchange Rate Forecasting

This repository contains code and resources for building a time-series model to Forecast Currency Exchange Rates between INR-USD..

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast future exchange rates between two currencies. The model will be trained on historical exchange rate data and evaluated on its ability to make accurate predictions on new unseen data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [name of the dataset], which contains historical exchange rate data between two currencies over a specific time period.

You can download the dataset from [link to dataset].

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: This directory contains Python scripts for various functions and classes used in the project.
- `models/`: This directory contains saved model files after training.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
